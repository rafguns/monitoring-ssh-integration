Diabetes and hypertension are increasingly dominant in the global burden of disease. Effective interventions for prevention, detection, treatment and control of both conditions are available, but do not reach all people in need.

This project examines the scale-up of existing evidence-based packages for control of diabetes and/or hypertension with five components: (a) identification of people with HT and/or T2D and (b) treatment in primary care services, (c) health education and (d) self-management support to patients and caregivers, and (e) collaboration among caregivers. The project develops, implements and evaluates roadmaps for the national scale-up of this package, in three different types of countries: a low-middle income country with a developing health system (Cambodia), a former socialist country with a centralised health system (Slovenia), and a Western European country with a decentralised system (Belgium).\nThe research objectives are: 1) to analyse the organisational capacity to scale-up the integrated care package and to assess contextual barriers and facilitators; 2) to develop and implement roadmaps for a national scale-up strategy in each country; 3) to evaluate the impact of scale-up on health outcomes and costs; and 4) to generate lessons for other countries. \nOutcomes. The project will result in comprehensive scale-up strategies and increased diabetes and hypertension control in each country.

This transformation process, named ETR for Endogenous Tissue Restoration, is the core technology for a new generation of very promising biodegradable vascular device currently developed by Xeltis. ETR makes the use of animal derived tissue, which is used in the majority of commercially available bioprosthetic heart valves, obsolete and avoids thereby durability related issues and potentially minimized the need for reoperations. Though, significant progress was made during the past years in developing ERT based devices, it remains very challenging, costly, time-consuming, and rich with obstacles. New knowledge can only be generated through a tedious trial & error process (requiring preclinical and clinical studies), since the restorative process cannot be replicated in an in-vitro environment.

Key factors related to the excessive mortality of these tumors are the lack of reliable screening methods and the complexity of diagnosis, which requires advanced imaging technology and difficult-to-access tissue. These barriers are amplified by poor accessibility present in resource-limited regions, all of which leads to tumors being diagnosed at advanced stages in which curative therapy is not an option. \nTo overcome these barriers, we propose to: A) validate immune-related markers in serum to predict HCC in South America and evaluate factors associated to early HCC development; B) define the utility of extracellular vesicles in serum as biomarkers for diagnosis of CCA and determine genetic and infectious factors that increase risk for this cancer; and C) identify biomarkers for GBC detection and evaluate novel immune factors that affect the geographical impact of this tumor. \nThis project advances the field by focusing on a unique approach to screen and diagnose tumors based on serum detection of biomarkers before a tumor is visible on imaging, allowing for early tumor detection in a cost effective manner that will lead to implementation of curative therapies.

Today, drug treatment of mental disorders is characterized by severe adverse effects and suboptimal response in more than a third of the patients. Optimizing treatment is based on a trial-and-error approach, which combined with frequent multi-morbidities, often leads to polypharmacy and poor outcome. Due to limited understanding of the disease mechanisms that underlie mental disorders, new drugs with novel therapeutic targets are lacking, and existing treatments are ineffective for many people. It is therefore urgent that cutting-edge research approaches are deployed to develop innovative tools to individualize treatments using available psychiatric medication, and thus improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs for health care systems. The main goal of the multidisciplinary REALMENT project is to optimize treatment of mental disorders through novel precision medicine strategies based on current pharmaceutical options.

Left ventricular dysfunction is the strongest predictor of adverse outcome after acute MI, and is associated with a 3 to 4-fold increase in mortality risk. In Westernised countries, heart failure is responsible for 1-2% of all health expenditure, which is mostly driven by repeated hospital admissions. Therefore, there is a considerable need for new therapies to limit the burden of CVD.\nThis application builds on a ground-breaking discovery by a unique team of clinicians and scientists who provided extensive validation for their findings through a series of basic, pre-clinical and translational research. Our goal is to translate this discovery into benefit for patients. The new therapy is based on selective targeting of a specific immune cell subset, mature B lymphocytes, with the aim to limit deleterious cardiac remodelling and improve heart function recovery post-MI.

Parenting interventions represent one approach to prevention of child mental health disorders, particular behavioral disorders, which could reduce the global burden of mental disorders in LMIC. However, addressing extending parenting intervention research to LMIC does not only require rigorous testing of the efficacy of interventions in new LMIC, but also requires increased attention to implementation, dissemination, and sustainability.

AMR is a critical global health issue tightly linked with the One Health concept, which recognises that human and animal health are inextricably linked, and that diseases are transmitted from humans to animals and vice versa. One Health also encompasses the environment as another link between humans and animals and a potential source and reservoir of AMR. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global health concern and threatens the future treatment and health of humans and animals. In addition, AMR limits our ability to achieve several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The global challenge to address AMR goes beyond the production of new antibiotics and therapies. Reducing demand for new antibiotics through public awareness, infection prevention and control, prudent and rational use of antibiotics for humans and animals, as well as effective diagnosis and surveillance of antibiotic-resistant infections and monitoring antibiotic use, are crucial when dealing with this problem globally. The transmission and spread of AMR in and between One Health compartments is complex, which emphasises the need for comprehensive interventions to reverse the trend of increasing human and animal infections resistant to treatment. The ERA-NET Cofund JPIAMR-ACTION will tackle this central challenge by supporting research and innovation for the development and testing of strategies and methodologies to reduce the transmission and spread of AMR within a full One Health spectrum.

In addition to significant impact on quality of life, AF exposes patients to stroke, heart failure, dementia and death. AF is the most commonly ablated arrhythmia. The Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of AF ablation, preventing recurrences, especially in patients with paroxysmal AF. Catheter ablation of AF uses either radio-frequency (RF) or cryothermal (cryo) energy. Common to these thermal energy sources is their reliance on time-dependent conductive heating/cooling and the fact that these modalities ablate all tissue types indiscriminately. The ablation procedure remains long, requires skills and expertise, and has a limited success rate, mostly because of non-durable lesions after PVI implying frequent redo procedures. And these energies are associated with rare but severe complications due to their thermal nature. The goal of BEAT AF is to disrupt AF ablation by achieving durable PVI with permanent, coalescent and transmural ablation lesions using Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) energy.  PEF is non-thermal and creates nanoscale pores in cell membranes. Cardiac cells are highly sensitive to PEF unlike phrenic and oesophageal cells. BEAT AF aims to demonstrate that PEF ablation is faster, more effective and safer (tissue selectivity) than RF or cryo ablation. For this purpose, two distinct randomized clinical trials will be conducted: 1) to provide first comparative evidence of the superiority of PEF over RF on the rate of 1-year recurrence for paroxysmal AF, and 2) to provide first evidence of potential efficacy of PEF on the rate of 1-year clinical recurrence for persistent AF.

The inability of the human heart to regenerate the myocardium lost due to acute myocardial infarction underlies a large part of chronic heart failure cases. To tackle this problem, REANIMA aims to deliver new therapies for heart regeneration, thereby reverting the conditions that lead to heart failure. Thus far, clinical trials based on introducing stem cells into the heart have not shown regenerative ability. In contrast, studies of spontaneous and induced heart regeneration in animal models strongly suggest a change in paradigm towards the reactivation of endogenous regenerative mechanisms. To develop this new path, REANIMA presents the first European basic-translational integrated effort in the cardiac regenerative field, with activities that span from the discovery of new targets in animal models to clinical trial design. REANIMA brings together knowledge on species that can regenerate their hearts \u2013fish and amphibians\u2013, animals that cannot regenerate their hearts \u2013adult mammals\u2013 and human engineered heart tissues. Strong synergy between partners will allow REANIMA to identify new pathways in regenerative animals and design strategies for their reactivation in non-regenerative animals and human tissue. REANIMA incorporates industrial and academic partners specialised in translational and pre-clinical research, who will develop advanced therapeutic medicinal products and new translational platforms. REANIMA will thus establish a translational pipeline using cross-species gene/protein therapy products with high translational potential, thereby boosting the rapid transition from basic research to the design of clinical trials.

The first main objective is to generate a vaccine that protect against the bacterial strains causing ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infections. To accomplish this we first select naturally protected individuals from high endemic regions and identify all neutralizing epitopes from the major outer membrane antigen (MOMP) of Chlamydia trachomatis through the unique combination of the B cell cloning and high density array technology. The epitopes will be produced as vaccines through the use of the immuno-repeat technology that is known to increase the quality and quantity of the vaccine promoted response. The second main objective is to develop an immunization protocol for optimal ocular mucosal immunity. To do this we will establish an ocular non-human primate (NHP) challenge model and use this to test different prime boost vaccination strategies for ocular responses and protection against challenge. We will subsequently test the best strategy in a clinical phase I evaluation of a trachoma vaccine based on a immuno-repeat construct targeting serovar B.

This will allow policy makers to grasp the components of the exposome that needs to be prioritized to be able to design targeted preventive policies to reduce healthcare and socioeconomic costs, leading to greater wellbeing for the EU population.\nEXIMIOUS will work together with the other projects (EXPANSE, HEAP, ATHLETE, EQUAL-LIFE, LONGITOOLS, EPHOR, REMEDIA and HEDIMED) funded within the Human Exposome programme call H2020-SC1-BHC-2018-2020, in order to achieve collaboration and synergy.", "rcn": 226545, "startDate": "2020-01-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "H2020-SC1-2019-Single-Stage-RTD", "title": "Mapping Exposure-Induced Immune Effects: Connecting the Exposome and the Immunome", "topics": "SC1-BHC-28-2019", "totalCost": 10878331.83, "topic": 2, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/874707", "x": 6.487292289733887, "y": 6.679880142211914, "count": 22, "representation": "human | exposure | chemicals | assessment | mnp | testing | methods | endocrine | effects | thyroid", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on studying the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on human health, with a particular emphasis on metabolic disorders, reproductive toxicity, and hormonal disturbances.

MICROB-PREDICT will assemble existing data and samples from major microbiome initiatives in hepatology (12 international studies, >10,000 patients), and enrich them with holistic and in-depth analysis using cutting-edge multi-omics technologies of host and microbiome from different body sites in samples of >1,000 patients collected in a longitudinal manner with sequential visits and controlling for confounders. \nMICROB-PREDICT results will foster more accurate, personalized risk stratification and significant steps towards personalized treatment of decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF.

Nearly all licensed vaccines mediate protection through the activity of antibodies and where vaccines are not available, passive infusion of monoclonal antibodies can fill the gap and control the infection. The overarching goal of the CoroNAb consortium is to rapidly identify, validate, and disseminate pre-clinical protein therapeutic candidates with neutralizing activity against 2019-nCoV, and to recommend where their use would be maximally effective.\n\nExpected results:\nOver the course of the project, we expect to design and synthesize recombinant variants of nCoV glycoproteins for immunization in mice, alpacas and macaques in order to generate and characterize multiple nCoV-neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies.

Due to rising cancer incidence rates and improving survival, the number of cancer patients living long enough to develop bone metastases is increasing rapidly. Metastatic bone pain is difficult to manage and has a detrimental impact on quality of life of patients, their partners and care-givers.\n\nRadiation therapy (RT), the standard treatment for palliation of metastatic bone pain, is easy to administer and well tolerated. However, RT is only effective in 60-70% of patients and usually takes four weeks before inducing pain response. Inadequate pain relief is therefore common and alternative treatment options are urgently needed. \n\nPain palliation may be substantially improved by including MR-HIFU as alternative or in addition to RT. Preliminary studies suggest that MR-HIFU  induces rapid pain relief (within days), and may palliate pain in patients in whom RT is not effective. Currently, strong evidence and context is lacking for wide-spread implementation of  MR-HIFU into routine care.\n\nThe FURTHER project aims to demonstrate (cost)effectiveness of MR-HIFU as an alternative or additional treatment option to relief metastatic bone pain. For this purpose, a three arm international randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 216 patients will be conducted comparing early and late pain response in patients treated with RT only, MR-HIFU only, and RT with MR-HIFU.  A prediction model will be developed to identify patients who are likely to benefit from MR-HIFU in order to allow (cost-) effective use of the treatment. In addition, a registry will be set up in which we will run the pain education study Educate-FURTHER, henceforth \"\"the Pain Education study\"\", to evaluate the effectiveness of adding pain education to the pain management strategy.

Using our optimized catheter-mediated intramyocardial approach with AdenoVEGF-D, which has never been used in man before our phase I trial, we aim to induce regenerative changes supported by therapeutic angiogenesis in the affected area of a patient's heart and, in a single procedure, reduce the burden on the individual and their health service. \n\nThe proposed trial is ready to proceed, subject to final regulatory approval in the seven clinical centres. 120 CCS class 2-3 refractory angina patients will be recruited, which will allow us to assess the benefits of therapy to patients who still have potential to respond to the regenerative therapy. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to either the gene therapy or placebo arms. \n\nTrial follow up, at 6 and 12 months, will assess how far they can walk in 6 minutes (primary endpoint) and also by their CCS angina score, quality of life, so-called MACE endpoints and several advanced PET and MRI imaging endpoints.", "rcn": 207197, "startDate": "2017-01-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "H2020-SC1-2016-RTD", "title": "Clinical development and proof of principle testing of new regenerative VEGF-D therapy for cost-effective treatment of refractory angina A phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study", "topics": "SC1-PM-11-2016-2017", "totalCost": 5934088.75, "topic": 3, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/731532", "x": 5.051918983459473, "y": 7.128962993621826, "count": 26, "representation": "stroke | patients | silico | clinical | trials | heart | drug | patient | treatment | af", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on innovative and personalized approaches to stroke treatment, including in-silico trials, precision medicine, thrombectomy efficacy, regenerative therapies, and predictive modeling.

Indeed current standard mammographic screening, with entry stratified by age alone, has recently been largely questioned. Despite a demonstrated mean 20% reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality, together with reduction of late-stage disease in women older than 50, it is associated with potential harms including false positive recalls and over-diagnosis. \nIndividual breast cancer risk estimation, through models including clinical variables, mammographic breast density and more than 100 genetic polymorphisms, now has substantial clinical and scientific bases. Personalized screening strategies, based on individual risk levels, could potentially improve the individual benefit/harms ratio of screening (earlier cancer detection and less intensive treatments in high risk women, less false positives and over-diagnoses in low risk ones), and increase the cost-efficacy for health insurances. \nMyPEBS will conduct an international randomized phase III trial to validate this hypothesis. It will primarily assess the ability of an individual risk-based screening strategy to be non-inferior, and possibly superior, to the standard of care screening, in reducing the cumulative incidence of stage II+ breast cancers. The trial, conducted in 5 countries (France, Italy,  UK, Belgium and Israel) will include 85000 European women aged 40-70, all followed for 4 years. MyPEBS will also evaluate if an individual risk-based screening strategy, compared with the standard, reduces screening-related harms (unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnoses) in low-risk women, is overall at least as cost-effective as well as more accepted by women resulting in a larger screening coverage.

Recent guidance has suggested abandoning keyhole surgery access, despite its cornerstone role in emergency and cancer therapy, its myriad benefits to patients, and the fact that a whole generation of surgeons would need retraining in open surgery to accomplish this safely. Laparoscopic surgery uses gas to distend a body cavity to make space for a camera and instruments to be inserted and worked by a surgical team. This gas is emptied from the patient by opening valves in the access instrumentation which typically enters the operating room (OR). The risks of venting gas can be addressed technologically by using more sophisticated and emerging insufflation technology.

The provision of adequate and cost-effective psychosocial and educational support for both patients and their frequently overburdened family caregivers is highly relevant from an economic, a healthcare and a prevention perspective.  Aims: The DIAdIC project is an interdisciplinary, cross-national project to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two psycho-educational dyadic interventions, i.e. interventions that target the patient and family caregiver together. One intervention is a web-based e-health intervention, one is nurse-led face-to-face intervention. Secondary aims are to assess the interventions' effects on vulnerable subgroups (e.g. people with a lower socioeconomic position), their effectiveness in different healthcare systems, and their suitability as perceived by end-users.   Concept and methods: The two interventions are tailored to dyads' needs and have 5 core components: (1) supporting family involvement, (2) reducing hopelessness, (3) increasing coping effectiveness, (4) reducing uncertainty and (5) teaching symptom management. They are based on existing interventions, developed in the USA, that have been shown to improve quality of life of both patient and family caregiver. The effectiveness of each of the interventions (compared to care as usual) will be assessed by way of an international randomized controlled trial in people with advanced cancer and their primary informal carers. The project includes a full health-economic evaluation and a thorough process evaluation.   Impact: The project advances the state of the art in several ways, e.g. by providing innovative healthcare interventions (including a eHealth solution) that embrace the philosophy and principles of early palliative care.

Their roots are opposite: COPD is currently considered to be mainly related to the external exposome, while factors outside of the exposome play a major role in CF. However, COPD and CF share common characteristics such as high phenotypic variability of unknown origin, which prevents good therapeutic efficacy. It is therefore clear that the overall picture must be supplemented by taking into account additional components of the exposome than those currently considered in COPD and CF. Thus, the overall objective of the REMEDIA project is to extend the understanding of the contribution of the exposome, taken as a complex set of different components, to COPD and CF diseases. We will exploit data from existing cohorts and population registries in order to create a unified global database gathering phenotype and exposome information; we will develop a flexible individual sensor device combining environmental and biomarker toolkits; and use a versatile atmospheric simulation chamber to simulate the health effects of complex exposomes. We will use machine learning supervised analyses and causal inference models to identify relevant risk factors; and econometric and cost-effectiveness models to assess the costs, performance and cost-effectiveness of a selection of prevention strategies. The results will be used to develop guidelines to better predict disease risks and constitute the elements of the REMEDIA toolbox (global unified database, sensor device, versatile atmospheric simulation chamber, machine learning supervised analyses, causal inference model, Pan-European multi-criteria risk assessment tool, econometric models, cost-effectiveness models, new guidelines and recommendations). Deciphering the impact of environmental components throughout life on the phenotypic variability of COPD and CF could represent a major breakthrough in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with these two non-curable diseases and would lead to the identification of modifiable risk factors on which preventive action could be implemented.

It is due to mutations in the DMD gene that preclude the production of the protein dystrophin. In addition to the progressive muscle weakness, 50% of affected individuals have debilitating central nervous system (CNS) co-morbidities, including intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental problems encompassing autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. These co-morbidities are due to the deficiency of multiple dystrophin isoforms in brain whose expression is differentially affected by the site of the DMD mutation. They represent a major obstacle for patients to live a fully independent life.  Current therapies do not address these co-morbidities. The postnatal restoration of one dystrophin isoform using genetic therapies in the DMD mouse model improves the neurobehavioral phenotype. This raises the exciting possibility that some of the CNS co-morbidities could improve with genetic therapies in patients. We need to address several knowledge gaps before considering clinical applications of these therapies: i. dystrophin isoforms localisation in the CNS; ii. which of the neurobehavioural features of the dystrophic mice improve after dystrophin restoration, and circuitries involved; iii. deep phenotype patients to define robust outcome measures.

ENDpoiNTs will address this need by i) integrating advanced expertise in the EDC and DNT fields, two so far rather independent toxicology communities, and ii) continuous interaction with European and international key stakeholders. By combining state-of-the-art in silico and in vitro tools, innovative experimental designs and technologies, and advanced biostatistics on human epidemiological and biomonitoring data, ENDpoiNTs will 1) Generate the necessary scientific insights on the correlative and causal links between endocrine disruption and DNT; 2) Develop predictive in silico tools for chemical screening using machine learning and combination of evidence; 3) Develop and validate in vitro tools for chemical screening and testing that address sex- and species differences; 4) Develop novel molecular endpoints for existing animal-based test guidelines by integrating in vitro, in vivo, and human omics data with behavioural outcomes; 5) Ensure human relevance by linking experimental and epidemiological evidence; 6) Develop an integrated testing approach based on the developed in silico, in vitro, and in vivo assays and molecular markers; 7) Ensure regulatory relevance by developing strategies for implementation of  these tools and endpoints into regulatory frameworks. In this way, ENDpoiNTs will meet the scientific, regulatory, and societal needs for improved hazard and risk assessment of EDCs", "rcn": 219148, "startDate": "2019-01-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD", "title": "Novel Testing Strategies for Endocrine Disruptors in the Context of Developmental NeuroToxicity", "topics": "SC1-BHC-27-2018", "totalCost": 7578990.0, "topic": 2, "socsci_project": true, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": true, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/825759", "x": 5.182582855224609, "y": 4.759423732757568, "count": 22, "representation": "human | exposure | chemicals | assessment | mnp | testing | methods | endocrine | effects | thyroid", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on studying the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on human health, with a particular emphasis on metabolic disorders, reproductive toxicity, and hormonal disturbances.

The trial will be conducted with phenotypic, molecular (integration sites, therapeutic gene expression) and functional readouts and should lead to effective treatment for > 70% of all SCID patients in Europe.

Viral infections such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) and Adenovirus (AdV) are major unsolved problems for patients receiving allogeneic HSCT. Refractory viral infections post-HSCT are rare, life-threatening conditions due to the deficient T-cell response post-SCT and lacking effective treatment options. Protective T-cell immunity could be restored by means of a procedure known as adoptive T-cell transfer. Although cellular immunotherapy is considered a major recent breakthrough in medicine, none of the cellular treatment approaches has yet become a standard treatment. The reason for this limited translation into daily clinical practice is the lack of controlled, prospective clinical trials investigating efficacy of immunotherapy. The objective of TRACE is to bring adoptive T-cell transfer into clinical routine as a life-saving, curative and safe treatment for refractory viral infection post-HSCT. TRACE is a multi-national clinical trial to prove efficacy and safety of adoptive T-cell transfer in immune-compromized individuals. For the first time, this trial will show that a unique individualized immunotherapy could be included into evidence based clinical routine in rare diseases. Regulatory and structural hurdles will be overcome by standardized GMP-procedures. It will be a major milestone in the development of medicine and health economics to bring such a unique personalized treatment approach into a clinical efficacy trial. The consortium provide excellence in immunotherapy through partners from basic, clinical and industrial research and GMP facilities, with proven qualification and expertise in the field of HSCT, GMP manufacturing and adoptive T-cell transfer.

This treatment gap is largest in low and middle income countries (LMIC), with detrimental effects on individuals (social role, quality of life, stigma) and societies (equity, costs). Peer support is an established intervention involving a person in recovery from mental illness being employed to offer support to others with mental illness. Peers are an untapped resource in global mental health.\nObjective and methods: UPSIDES will scale-up peer support interventions for people with severe mental illness in high-, middle- and low-resource settings. An international community of practice for peer support including peer support workers, mental health researchers, and other relevant stakeholders in Europe, Africa and Asia (8 study sites in 6 countries) will be established. Peer support will be implemented adapted to the local context. Using a mixed-methods approach (N=558), the impact of peer support will be rigorously evaluated at the levels of patients and peer support workers (psychosocial and clinical outcomes), services (cost-effectiveness, return on investment), and implementation (adoption, sustainability, organisational change). Evidence of best practice will be disseminated to local, national and international stakeholders ensuring sustainability and spread. \nExpected impact: UPSIDES will improve the lives of large numbers of citizens in Europe and LMIC by modifying mental health systems using the expertise of people with personal experience of mental illness.

In the face of this potential huge leap forward, the fact that personalised health lacks the cooperation and coordination needed to organise the still very fragmented field is a severe drawback to its development and to the placement of investments in an effective manner. For this reason, it is crucial to direct major efforts towards coordinating and aligning relevant stakeholders in personalised health action across Europe and beyond; create a participatory approach; build trust; enable a multi-stakeholder process; channel investments towards Personalised Health.\nAll this considered, Regions4PerMed will coordinate regional policies and innovation programmes in Personalised Medicine and Personalised Health to accelerate the deployment of PH for citizens and patients. The project will reinforce the cooperation between H 2020 and ESIF on PH aspects; Strengthen industrial specialisation areas in Europe and allow PH to flourish as an Emerging Industry; Enable interregional joint investment on PH, including a stable link with Vanguard Initiative and with the European Innovation Council.", "rcn": 218616, "startDate": "2018-11-01", "status": "CLOSED", "subCall": "H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD", "title": "INTERREGIONAL COORDINATION FOR A FAST AND DEEP UPTAKE OF PERSONALISED HEALTH", "topics": "SC1-HCO-01-2018-2019-2020", "totalCost": 1720000.0, "topic": 1, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/825812", "x": 8.395942687988281, "y": 7.6801886558532715, "count": 35, "representation": "research | icpermed | pm | health | innovation | eu | funding | support | permed | personalised", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on advancements in personalised medicine research and collaboration on an international scale.
