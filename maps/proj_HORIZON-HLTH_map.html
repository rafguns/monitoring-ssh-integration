Most interventions suffer from not adapting to personal context (e.g. socioeconomic aspects, host-biological factors, environment, dietary preferences, fitness level etc.), focus only on diet or physical activity alone, do especially overlook emotional aspects, and fail to engage and motivate the user. Thus, initiatives on obesity prevention in policy and practice are often of marginal impact. HealthyW8 will address these shortcomings by iteratively developing, together with stakeholders, a digital-based healthy lifestyle recommender for evidence-based, tailored interventions and tools including a human digital twin to bridge the gap between science, societal actors and stakeholders (e.g. healthcare professionals, food industries, policymakers) and EU citizens. The targeted populations are those undergoing  transitions, i.e. schoolchildren (5-10 y, and their parents), young adults (18-25 y) and the elderly (>65 y). In the mid-term, we estimate that with 200,000 HealthyW8 users, we will prevent 10,000 obesity cases/y. In the long run, the impact will be maximized through adopting the project\u2019s proposed methodology, platform and tools by as many EU institutions and entities as possible. HealthyW8 is a highly experienced, synergistic and complementary consortium that will built on a previously developed digital dietary app (LIFANA) and draw on transdisciplinary research in pan-EU multicentre pilots and long-term randomized control trials to achieve its overarching objective of increasing impact of current and future obesity prevention interventions and policies in the EU.", "rcn": 250691, "startDate": "2023-05-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-HLTH-2022-STAYHLTH-01-two-stage", "title": "Empowering healthy lifestyle behaviour through personalised intervention portfolios to prevent and control obesity during vulnerable stages of life", "topics": "HORIZON-HLTH-2022-STAYHLTH-01-05-two-stage", "totalCost": 10000000.0, "topic": 9, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101080645", "x": 1.5435949563980103, "y": 5.749439716339111, "count": 14, "representation": "obesity | prevention | interventions | urban | ncds | health | implementation | ncd | weight | adolescents", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on childhood obesity interventions and prevention strategies in various settings, with an emphasis on personalized and sustainable approaches.

In particular, in cancer screening, AI helps patients to make better-informed decisions and reduce medical error.

These obstacles can be overcome with swarm learning (SL) where partners jointly train AI models without sharing any data. Yet, access to SL technology is seriously limited because no studies have implemented SL in a true multinational setup, no practically usable implementation of SL is available, researchers & healthcare providers have no experience with setting up SL networks and policymakers are currently unaware of the broader implications of SL. ODELIA will address & solve these issues: ODELIA will build the first open-source software framework for SL, providing an assembly line for the streamlined development of AI solutions.

Nonclinical data has recently been published in Cell and a preprint on BiorxIV. XVR011 is a nanobody-Fc fusion, has best-in-class potential, neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and minimizes the development of lung damage in hamsters. The lama-derived single-domain antibodies are smaller than human antibodies and can attach to parts of a virus that are difficult to access for the human immune system. XVR011 inactivates spike proteins and sterically blocks spike binding to ACE2, preventing virus from entering a human cell, stopping viral replication; this supplements the patient's own immune response in a critical time window during which many COVID-19 patient's immune system reacts too slowly, giving it more time to do its job and eliminate the virus. It binds to a unique highly conserved epitope in the viral receptor-binding domain. Its epitope is much less susceptible to human antibody immunity pressure that can lead to viral escape, resulting in retained potency against such escape variants. It thus neutralises the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, and exhibits a unique, wide scope binding across the Sarbecovirus clades. Furthermore, XVR011 has been optimized for stability, safety and manufacturability. XVR011 received approval from the Belgium regulators to move into its Phase 1b. Seven IP patents were filed early on during the pandemic. ExeVir has surrounded itself with both a team of experienced entrepreneurs and is backed by a mix of private and public experienced partners and has a strong board of directors bringing with expertise across the whole value chain.

Many exposure parameters of 5G are similar to those of 2G-4G. However, there are also many differences that lead to major knowledge gaps, all of which will be addressed by the SEAWave project. SEAWave will (i) quantify the differences in exposure patterns between 2G-4G and 5G for the entire population including children; (ii) provide new tools and instruments for reliable exposure evaluation of base stations, local networks in factories, and end-user devices; (iii) provide the means to minimise exposure; (iv) generate important new scientific data for assessing the health risk from exposure to the new frequency bands (FR2), especially with regard to the potential (co-)carcinogenicity of skin exposure and other hazardous effects; and (v) provide knowledge for effective health risk communication and dissemination to various stakeholders. To achieve these ambitious objectives, the interdisciplinary consortium consists of highly experienced partners with leading expertise in the field who ideally complement each other to achieve maximum impact.

In addition, extending anticoagulation indefinitely in all patients with unprovoked VTE exposes 65% of patients to an unjustified high risk of bleeding, who would never have experienced recurrent VTE after stopping treatment.\n\tIn this setting, optimal duration and management of anticoagulation remains a pivotal and unresolved challenging issue which has the potential to markedly improve long-term prognosis of unprovoked VTE. Based on quantitative and qualitative approaches, MORPHEUS will for the first time integrate (i) clinical, laboratory and imaging biomarkers (personalized medicine) and (ii) socio-anthropological markers (patient-centred model) into sets of prediction rules for optimizing anticoagulant management integrated in a shared decision-making process. The ultimate goal of the European \u201cMORPHEUS\u201d project will be to develop and validate a time-dependent multi-component tool integrated in a shared decision-making process regarding anticoagulant treatment duration in patients with unprovoked VTE. The whole MORPHEUS program, leaded by a consortium of outstanding European researchers in the field of VTE, will constitute a major breakthrough compared with the present standard of care in patients with unprovoked VTE with major scientific, public health, economic, and societal impacts.", "rcn": 258140, "startDate": "2023-12-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-HLTH-2022-TOOL-11", "title": "PROGNOSIS IMPROVEMENT OF UNPROVOKED VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM USING PERSONALIZED ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY", "topics": "HORIZON-HLTH-2022-TOOL-11-01", "totalCost": 9958833.5, "topic": 17, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101095698", "x": 4.103241920471191, "y": 10.474613189697266, "count": 21, "representation": "patients | clinical | disease | ht | treatment | ckd | virtual | patient | hcm | vte", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on personalized medicine applications in healthcare, including optimized drug response, virtual twins for individual care, and advanced therapies.

To tackle this issue, CARE-IN-HEALTH propose to identify the resolution of inflammation to develop new prevention strategies to lower inflammation with a retained immune defence against infections to sustainably stay healthy.

Understanding spillover dynamics and threats at local levels in emerging disease hotspot areas, such as Southeast Asia, is important for the European Union to improve preparedness and the ability to respond quickly to health emergencies and cross-border threats.

Solution: the PAL-CYCLES programme: a transitional palliative care programme for patients with advanced cancer, adaptable to local cultures and healthcare systems. The programme contains an intervention aiming for a smooth transition from hospital care to community care, consisting of five cornerstone components: (1) identification of a patient with palliative and supportive care needs in collaboration with the oncologist and the hospital palliative care team; (2) compassionate communication towards the patient and their family; (3) a collaborative multidimensional care plan and follow-up in the home care setting; (4) periodic evaluation of the care plan with patients and relatives; (5) identification of the terminal phase (if there) based on the periodic evaluations, with appropriate intensification of care and end-of-life talks depending on local possibilities and habits, including consultation with patient and families about ethically and legally sensitive issues. Plan: we intend to develop, adapt, implement, and evaluate the PAL-CYCLES programme in seven European countries using a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial design. Patient, relatives, and health care provider experiences, as well as ethical and equity issues will be addressed with qualitative methods.

This results in supply chain fragility and low crisis preparedness in Europe. New methods to produce pharmaceuticals in a green, efficient, and economically friendly way are required.\n\nThe IMPACTIVE project brings together the expertise and knowledge from two COST Actions and will develop novel green methods to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) using mechanochemistry as a disruptive technology (as acknowledged by IUPAC). Mechanochemistry uses mechanical processes, such as ball milling, twin-screw extrusion, resonant acoustic mixing, and spray drying, to induce chemical reactions. \n\nThe advantages of mechanochemistry include: no solvent use, high efficiency, low costs, and reduced energy use and CO2 emission. Upon completion of the project, we will provide proof-of-concept at a small pilot scale of the use of mechanochemistry to produce 6 APIs from 3 different families of compounds. Based on a recent study, switching to mechanochemistry can reduce terrestrial ecotoxicity and CO2 emissions by more than 85%, while production costs were reduced with 12%.

Although only a small proportion of long bone fractures evolve to non-union (5%), it is a first magnitude problem due to the number of new annual fractures and increasing incidence of complex fractures with high risk of non-consolidation, need for repeated procedures and years of patient disability. Bone autografts, autologous mesenchymal cells, or other complex interventions are used in this setting. \nThe aim of this project is the development of a universal therapy for fractures with delay or failure to heal, aiming to a simple and wide access to allogenic cell therapy combined with biomaterial, in a broad number of patients. Rather than considering ATMP only as a last solution in established non-union fractures, this project advocates that the indication should be moved to an earlier timepoint. Patients will be treated with the combined ATMP as soon as the need for reoperation is identified due to delayed healing, with or without an added infectious component, to avoid long-term suffering for patients and their relatives, and prevent progression to more severe non-unions, with heavy personal, social and economic costs. This approach is aligned with the real needs of patients and better fits with the usual practice in the EU, where reoperations are performed at 6 months or before, in an attempt to accelerate bone healing and avoid complications. \nThe project will establish a master cell bank for a wide allogenic production with donors selection criteria of bone formation potential. Necessary preclinical and clinical information to support the EU approval of a specific combined ATMP will be obtained.

Its efficacy is hampered by the risk of death/drop-out on the Wait List (WL). This risk is driven by organ shortage and is mitigated by organ offering schemes. According to a sickest first policy, offering schemes prioritize LT candidates with the highest risk of dying, as assessed by predictive models. To drive allocation, Organ Sharing Organizations (OSOs) use a 20-year-old model, the MELD, predicting mortality in DC but not in HCC. Because of a dramatic increase in % of HCC candidates (40% against 10% in early 20ties), MELD schemes are increasingly inaccurate, with persisting 15 to 30% mortality in countries with low/medium donation rate. This scenario, together with advances in prognosis in DC and HCC candidates and statistics, prompts LT community to look for up-dated algorithms to refine offering schemes. To address this issue, key European LT stakeholders including OSOs, experts in LT, Statisticians, Research Labs and SME joined LEOPARD. Building on an innovative, harmonized OSOs pre-LT dataset and advances in modeling, LEOPARD propose to design and validate 1) an AI-based LEOPARD predictive algorithm outperforming current allocation models by better stratifying patients on the risk of mortality, to be proposed OSOs to drive allocation; 2)  DC & HCC LEOPARD calculators available for professional for assistance in complex decision-making processes; 3) OMICs/radiomics predictive signatures integrated in a prototype 3rd-generation exploratory model.

Hepatitis D is caused by coinfection of hepatitis B patients with the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Up to 20 Million individuals are infected with HDV worldwide including about 250.000 patients in the European Union. There is very limited knowledge on disease pathophysiology and host-virus interactions explaining the large interindividual variability in the course of hepatitis D. It is in particular unknown why 20-50% are spontaneously able to control HDV replication, why the majority but not all patients progress to advanced stages of liver disease and why only some patients show off-treatment responses to antiviral treatment with either pegylated interferon alpha or the novel HBV/HDV entry inhibitor bulevirtide. As HDV is an orphan disease, no multicenter cohorts of HDV infected patients are available with appropriate biobanking. There is also no reliable animal model available allowing to study host responses. Thus, there is an urgent clinical, social and economic need to better understand individual factors determining the outcome of infection and to identify subjects benefitting from currently available treatments.  Hepatitis D is a protype infection which could hugely benefit from a novel individualized infectious medicine approach.

To remedy this, we herein present a new concept and technology - continuous stratification, using our new STRATIF-AI platform. In continuous stratification, all data generated about a patient is cumulatively stored in a Personal Data Vault, controlled by the patient. These personal data continuously updates our world-unique digital twins. The unique potential with our twins comes from the hybrid architecture, combining mechanistic, multi-scale, and multi-organ models with ML and bioinformatics. This allows us to simulate patient-specific responses to changes in diet, exercise, and certain medications, and see changes on both an intracellular, organ, and whole-body level, ranging from seconds to years. We also combine semantic harmonization with federated learning to securely re-train the various sub-models, when new data become available in one of the cohort databases. In this project, we will for the first time use this cutting-edge technology to connect a series of apps that together covers an entire patient journey. Using 6 new clinical studies, involving 8 new partner hospitals, we will both refine and validate the models, and demonstrate how the same digital twin can follow a patient across different apps, covering all phases of stroke: from prevention, to acute treatment, and rehabilitation.

As no registered causal therapy exists, management of CHI aims at increasing blood glucose levels causing severe side effects in all patients while life-threatening frequent hypoglycaemias remain.

This hypothesis is addressed by analysing adaptive and innate immune responses to EVs, correlating these with gene polymorphisms and EV persistence in children followed from birth and who developed T1D.\n\n3. How can EV-associated T1D risk be attenuated? By using vaccines inducing protective immunity and antiviral drugs eradicating persistent infection. This hypothesis is addressed by examining samples from pioneering EV vaccine and T1D antiviral trials to develop biomarkers of vaccine- vs infection-induced immunity as surrogates of vaccine efficacy; by studying whether vaccine-induced antibodies prevent EV-induced diabetes in mice; by correlating antiviral treatment with EV clearance and immunity to identify biomarkers for EV eradication and patient selection.\n\nThe final goal is to identify individuals at risk for EV-induced T1D as targets for early interventions.

Transplantation of autologous, genetically modified hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is an attractive therapeutic option for SCD patients. To this end, genome editing approaches based on the use of site-specific nucleases or, more recently, base editors have been explored by many groups, including teams in our consortium. These approaches either correct the single point mutation causing SCD or reactivate fetal gamma-globin expression by mimicking HPFH mutations.

In Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD), there is mounting evidence of a preclinical phase characterized by immunological changes that precede symptoms. Here, we propose a thorough and innovative approach to better understand the health-to-chronic inflammation transition occurring in patients with CD that will be translated in improved disease prediction and prevention. We will address how changes in glycosylation of the gut mucosa act as a primary event that dysregulates not only local mechanisms (imposing maladapted host-microbiome interactions) but also systemic mechanisms (promoting anti-microbial antibodies production), involving the novel concept of glycan mimicry as an early trigger of the health to inflammation transition \u2013 GlycanTrigger. Capitalizing on our recent findings showing that changes in the expression of complex branched N-glycans at gut mucosa regulate Inflammatory Bowel Disease immunopathogenesis, we here hypothesize that changes in gut glycocalyx impose early perturbations in host-microbiome interactions, leading to the exposure of altered (glyco)neoantigens, both by pathogens and host epithelial cells which trigger the activation of innate immune response.

MTB and AB are clinically problematic bacteria with alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), while MU is an important neglected tropical disease. Although vaccines are recognized as highly effective tools to mitigate AMR and tropical diseases, effective vaccine development for these (facultative) intracellular bacteria is held back by a lack of known antigens, and by current vaccine platforms struggling to elicit the required strong cellular immune responses. We will overcome both limitations here through two key innovations: (i) novel proteomics and proteomics informatics approaches for immunopeptidomics to allow highly sensitive discovery and prioritization of bacterial epitopes presented on infected cells; and (ii) novel mRNA vaccines to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, with innovative adjuvants to strengthen adaptive immunity, and to modulate innate immunity. Vaccine production will be done according to GMP standards, and we will pursue novel, low-cost production methods to enable local production and much-needed improved vaccine stability.\nWe will characterize innate and adaptive immune responses in detail in human cellular models and mouse infection models.

Children and pregnant women who have not been prioritised in the pandemic, are likely to be the last population for whom vaccines are approved and may have low uptake, increasing the risk of VoC arising in this population. Monitoring this group across regions is crucial given rapid changes in epidemiology due to interventions, vaccine rollout and viral evolution. VERDI (SARS-CoV-2 variants Evaluation in pRegnancy and paeDIatrics cohorts) will build on a long-standing infectious disease research and trial network (Penta) to address research questions on the impact of VoC in these vulnerable groups.\n\nMpox virus (known as monkeypox or MPX, when this application was originally written) is a zoonotic Orthopox virus first described in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970. It is an infection of global significance, with cases reported in 11 African countries and sporadic cases reported outside Africa as a result of zoonotic transmission and travellers returning from endemic areas. However, despite the global burden of monkeypox disease, research into monkeypox has historically been neglected. This current outbreak of monkeypox is, like many communicable and non-communicable diseases, a complex biosocial phenomenon, disproportionately impacting marginalised communities, whilst exposing and amplifying global health inequities.\n\nSince May 2022, large numbers of monkeypox cases have been reported in non-endemic countries. As of 9 September 2022, there have been 57,527 confirmed cases of monkeypox since the start of the 2022 outbreak, with the vast majority being reported in non-endemic countries. Of the 103 countries reporting cases in this current outbreak, 96 are countries which have not historically reported monkeypox cases. A recently published case series of 528 patients in 16 countries, reported that 98% of cases were in gay or bisexual men, with 41% also living with HIV. Sexual contact has been found to be the dominant method of transmission in this current outbreak. In this case series, 13% of cases were hospitalised, mainly for pain management, bacterial super-infection, and fluid management.\n\nVERDI\u2019s objectives are: i) track and characterise VoC and MPX in paediatric and pregnant populations and other high risk populations across the globe;\nii)\u2004understand effects of VoC and MPX on clinical outcomes (short/longer term), vaccine effectiveness and transmission characteristics; iii) model outcomes and impacts of VoC and MPX; iv) develop evidence-based recommendations for control of COVID-19 and MPX and other emerging or re-emerging infections.\n\nVERDI will achieve these objectives by bringing together a diverse range of cohort studies including large scale national and regional level population-based cohort studies from the EU and beyond, providing a unique opportunity for harmonised analysis of data on VoC and MPX from a range of sources (e.g. electronic health records, bespoke cohort studies, household transmission studies, screening programmes). We will facilitate expansion of existing studies, e.g. replicating ongoing European household studies elsewhere. Through this approach, VERDI will expand and enhance existing cohort networks, including promoting flexibility to adapt to future emerging infections.
