Nonetheless, in recent years, we have witnessed a series of natural and human-induced disasters that threaten it. Improving cultural heritage resilience to climate change and anthropogenic hazards requires a shift in conservation practices towards more holistic ones. ChemiNova aims to develop an intelligent computational system that goes beyond current technologies to improve the conservation, analysis and monitoring of European cultural heritage assets.

We will involve local communities in conservation practices, from providing data (citizen science) to raising awareness on the effects of climate change, natural and human hazards affecting CH. As a main objective, we will develop novel and cost-effective ways for remote and on-site monitoring of cultural heritage assets by reusing existing technologies and providing conservators with advanced analysis of structural and chemical damages due to human-induced threats.

The TWON can then be used to study counterfactuals, such as: How would the effects look like, had the OSN been designed differently?\n\nIn order to achieve that, the TWON project will combine empirical observations of existing OSNs, theory-informed simulations, and specific case studies. These form an iterative process, in which we will build and refine the TWON. If successful, this would be a major leap towards a better understanding of platform mechanics, both for the scientific community and for societal stakeholders. The TWON project will produce evidence-based recommendations for regulatory innovations regarding OSNs and enhance digital citizenship by participatory methods. This can reduce the detrimental effects on democratic debates when platforms are primarily optimized for economic gain. TWON enables OSN research in a controlled but naturalistic environment that would not be possible relying on for-profit OSN operators. The effectiveness of the TWON method will be demonstrated in two case studies on two diametrically controversial ongoing debates: the conflict in Ukraine and COVID-19.", "rcn": 243502, "startDate": "2023-04-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01", "title": "TWin of Online Social Networks", "topics": "HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-07", "totalCost": 2989758.13, "topic": 8, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101095095", "x": 2.0535707473754883, "y": 8.755558967590332, "count": 8, "representation": "media | democracy | gans | political | accountability | democratic | communication | platforms | corruption | twon", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on the intersection of media, democracy, and digital technologies, exploring topics such as resilient media, political corruption, social networks, corporate responsibility, civic resilience, and value-based adversarial networks.

Europe has demonstrated unexpected unity and resolve, adopting a series of sanctions against Russia, and increasing national defence spending to better handle potential military threats. This has also led to a revival of EU enlargement process. While this will not improve EU resilience to military threats in the narrow sense, it may counter hybrid warfare, which is the more likely threat faced by the EU and most of its neighbours. \nThe neighbourhood policy and the accession process require urgent adjustment to build strong, resilient neighbourhood states capable of countering external threats, particularly those posed by hybrid warfare. A systematic investigation of how this can be achieved in the current context without compromising the EU\u2019s values and security is therefore needed. Since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, there have been increasing calls from the EU for a more context-sensitive approach to its neighbours. RE-ENGAGE will assist the EU in determining how best to achieve this goal through an in-depth study of six cases \u2013 three in the Western Balkans and three in the Eastern Neighbourhood.", "rcn": 258090, "startDate": "2024-01-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01", "title": "Re-Engaging with Neighbours in a State of War and Geopolitical Tensions", "topics": "HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-08", "totalCost": 2982125.0, "topic": 1, "socsci_project": true, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": true, "url": "https://doi.org/", "x": 0.926005482673645, "y": 9.515275001525879, "count": 15, "representation": "fimi | eu | information | china | suppression | policy | russia | foreign | global | ukraine", "summary": "This cluster of projects centers on the manipulation of information in global governance, focusing on topics such as information suppression, foreign interference, multilateral cooperation, and the impact of various policies.

LET\u00b4S CARE will create a theoretical and practical framework to foster Safe Learning, Safe Teaching, Safe Schools and Safe Education in each level as an approach to break the chain of transgenerational transmission of educational and social exclusion. This approach will generate lower rates of school failure, poor learning outcomes and early school leaving. The main proposal breakthrough is based on considering a relational response to educational exclusion and inequality, resulting in a model for understanding the importance of security to address underachievement and early drop out, and a relational approach to inclusive practices at school that will be translated into tools, recommendations and guidelines for action, from ECEC to secondary and Second Chance schools. A multilevel, multistage and intersectional research, exploring different European educational contexts, will be implemented, including120 schools, 18,000 students, and 2,400 teachers from 6 European countries in 4 schools stages, with special attention to multi-disadvantaged learners. LET\u00b4S CARE, supported by a expert consortium, will implement a holistic methodological approach, including cocreation mechanisms, and will translate research findings into political approach, through formulation of novel evidence-based policy recommendations, raising awareness on safe/caring schools, combating social exclusion of disadvantaged learners.", "rcn": 238750, "startDate": "2022-10-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL2-2021-TRANSFORMATIONS-01", "title": "LET\u00b4S CARE: BUILDING SAFE AND CARING SCHOOLS TO FOSTER EDUCATIONAL INCLUSION AND SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT", "topics": "HORIZON-CL2-2021-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-04", "totalCost": 2953671.88, "topic": 0, "socsci_project": true, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": true, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101059425", "x": 1.9904959201812744, "y": 4.654582977294922, "count": 16, "representation": "educational | learning | education | skills | students | training | longitudinal | project | inequalities | school", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on leveraging technology to enhance equity and inclusion in education through efficient training, intelligent systems, and longitudinal data analysis.

Hence ageing must be viewed in terms of a life course approach. Secondly, given inherent uncertainties, new policies \u2013 and revisions of old ones \u2013 ought to be resilience enhancing. They should enable both citizens and service providers to cope and adapt to whatever the next shock will be. A focus on resilience means that policies must be thought of in terms of proactive planning, adaptability, flexibility and where possible, prevention, rather than post-hoc solutions to challenges related to the ageing of the population. But they must also factor in the way that individuals are linked through families, social networks, environment, communities, nation states and also supra-national entities, such as the European Union (EU).

FIERCE will cover eight case studies (France, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Turkey, Denmark, Poland, Spain) representing a wide variety of country contexts in socio-political, geographical and welfare terms. FIERCE moves beyond a country-based approach and provides a cross-cutting comparative analysis of the way debates and controversies on gender have influenced the dynamics and output of the policy process. Building on co-creation methods and on a strong alliance with civil society organisations, FIERCE proposes pilot actions that can reinvigorate democratic practices, in line with feminist inclusive visions for the future of democracy.

Combining both rigorous academic research and hands-on analysis through the Living Lab, RECHARGE will deliver a Playbook containing the ingredients and recipes that can be adapted to local environments to create participatory business models for their communities. The online Knowledge Base, populated with research results, will support the uptake in the sector and among interested communities, while the Academy will engage the CHI networks and build capacity to make a real difference in the landscape of CHIs. RECHARGE boasts a multidisciplinary team bringing together different university departments, independent research organizations and CHI representatives from six EU countries.

In social media and through the connections between social and \u201ctraditional\u201d media, extremist narratives are naturalized and have an impact on mainstream narratives. \nARENAS will provide concrete responses to the consequences of these extremist narratives by: i) measuring and mapping the spread of extremist narratives; ii) defining remediation actions for individuals and groups affected by extremist narratives; iii) providing educational and institutional propositions to anticipate future challenges in terms of the construction and circulation of extremist narratives; and iv) identifying multi-level policy recommendations to help counter extremist narratives, both at the institutional and political level, and at the level of associations and citizens.", "rcn": 243759, "startDate": "2023-05-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01", "title": "Analysis of and Responses to Extremist Narratives", "topics": "HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05", "totalCost": 2999991.25, "topic": 5, "socsci_project": true, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": true, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101094731", "x": 1.2941629886627197, "y": 9.275001525878906, "count": 24, "representation": "political | social | democracy | citizens | democratic | project | narratives | politics | trust | emotions", "summary": "This cluster of projects explores democratic governance, political emotions, and societal trust in European democracies.

We focus on seven European countries with different social and political backgrounds, and the EU level. This knowledge allows us to better understand everyday practices of democracy and how the current backlash resonates with broader exclusionary tendencies and fundamental problems of the Western democracy model.

Indeed, this lacuna becomes even more pronounced when one considers those attempts that go beyond conventional forms of state-led participation. Responding to this gap, the aim of Fairville is to both document and propose pilot models of urban intervention that engage local academics, -authorities, -community-based organisations, -residents and -users in the collective improvement of deprived urban neighbourhoods via a deepening of resident and user participation in new and existing democratic processes. The idea that urban policies should not be made \"\"for\"\" populations but rather \u201cwith\"\" them is a potentially profound engine of social transformation and empowerment. However, the realisation of such co-production processes is often marked by epistemic inequalities and unequal power relations. Cognisant of this issue, the Fairville pilot cases all place an emphasis on exploring the ways in which academic researchers, local communities and local authority representatives can work together to reduce the power and information asymmetries that exist between them. Clustered around three major themes - environmental inequalities, inequalities related to housing and urban planning and inequalities related to climate risks \u2013 and ranging from co-diagnosis to co-planning and intervention, the pilots will be carried out as action research and include the implementation of observation, capitalisation and co-evaluation mechanisms.

It is recognised that future labour markets will be more mobile with more people moving between jobs, employers, and sectors more often. This poses a problem for training systems insofar as employers may be much less willing than in the past to fund and provide training because their chances of appropriating the return will have been reduced. The study is concerned with understanding how skill systems can better respond to meeting skill demands in a more fluid labour market environment. The starting point is that of considering whether there is a need to provide individuals with a wider range of capabilities to weather a greater range of labour market challenges than those faced by their counterparts from previous generations. Some countries have been able to use their skills systems to deliver more of these capabilities than others, though the impact of this on labour market transitions is uncertain (something the current study addresses). If skills systems are to confer skills on individuals which provide them with increased resilience and capability, then there is a need to know what those capabilities or skills are in practice. The research addresses this from both a demand side (what are the skills which are currently in demand and are likely to be so in the future?) and a supply side (to what extent are these capabilities reflected in VET programmes) perspective.

Nevertheless, GANs also constitute an opportunity to enhance democratic awareness and expand active and inclusive citizenship.\nSOLARIS reacts to these challenges in two ways. On the one hand, we analyse political risks associated with these technologies, to prevent negative implications for EU democracies. As a result, SOLARIS will establish regulatory innovations to detect and mitigate deepfake risks. On the other hand, we assess the opportunities raised by GANs for reinvigorating the democratic engagement of citizens. We will co-create, involving citizen science, value-based GANs contents to enhance democratic engagement. SOLARIS involves three use cases: the first aims at understanding the psychological aspects of GANs perceived trustworthiness. The second simulates the circulation of threatening GANs contents on social media, to detect risks and design mitigation strategies. The third co-creates value-based GANs contents to boost awareness on key global democratic topics (e.g: climate change, gender dimension, human migration), to ultimately enhance active and inclusive digital citizenship.", "rcn": 243763, "startDate": "2023-02-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01", "title": "Strengthening demOcratic engagement through vaLue-bAsed geneRative adversarIal networkS", "topics": "HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-07", "totalCost": 2761250.0, "topic": 8, "socsci_project": true, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": true, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101094665", "x": 2.2817537784576416, "y": 8.47967529296875, "count": 8, "representation": "media | democracy | gans | political | accountability | democratic | communication | platforms | corruption | twon", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on the intersection of media, democracy, and digital technologies, exploring topics such as resilient media, political corruption, social networks, corporate responsibility, civic resilience, and value-based adversarial networks.

Yet the rules-based international order and multilateralism are widely believed to be in crisis. The emerging powers and populist forces have contested and put demands on global governance often resulting in a gridlock of international cooperation. The Russian war in Ukraine will likely further undermine the ability to address global problems. ENSURED, a project with 14 partners from the EU, US and the BRICS, studies how the EU and its members, in a contested world in transition, can transform and defend global governance to make it more robust, effective and democratic. Integrating different literatures on international institutions and EU foreign policy, ENSURED develops a conceptual framework on global governance transformation. It outlines a triangular dilemma in which the EU and its members must make choices between the robustness, effectiveness and democracy of global governance. It also considers, in this respect, different scenarios for multilateralism in a contested world in transition. Through case studies of five policy areas, a quantitative analysis and expert survey, ENSURED empirically assesses and compares the unexploited potential for global governance transformation. It thus highlights areas where global governance transformation is most likely.

While the globalisation and liberalisation of markets triggered a period of unprecedented growth ? as well as improvements in standards of living and consolidation of liberal democracies ? in the decades following the Second World War, we have recently witnessed a substantial reversal in these trends. Today, globalisation and global corporations rather appear to bring challenges to liberal democracy, social cohesion as well as the environment. The academic literature studying these developments often focuses on describing and interpreting what is going ?wrong?. However, the key challenge is to outline and understand the new type of politics that is emerging in its place as well as to envisage and develop the contours of new promising approaches to re-embed democracy and capitalism. This key challenge lies at the heart of the DemoTrans project, and we address it by bringing together a multidisciplinary consortium of six experienced and leading research groups from four European research universities and an NGO with a strong track record.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a wake-up call to rethink how cultural production and consumption are organized and articulated with different sets of actors and local contexts, towards safeguarding sustainability, access and the well-being of the sector, its workforce and surrounding communities. Long before the pandemic crisis, European cultural policy encouraged museums to embrace participatory governance and digitisation (European Commission, 2010 ), become more financially self-reliant and diversify their income-generating activities. It is thus vital to map pre-pandemic practices across the sector, to fully account the pandemic effects on the sector and to explore novel solutions that will inform GLAMs response and adaptation to the post-pandemic era, under a new conceptual paradigm that will advance GLAMs as the agents of change.

Given this new relevance of political writing, CAPONEU\u2019s goal is to assess the political novel as an important element of the European cultural heritage and as a tool for community building and European advocacy. The consortium brings together an interdisciplinary research team that seeks not only to unpack the rich literary heritage of the 20th century but also (through collaboration with a wide range of actors) to make the PNE experiences relevant to our present. It allows us to understand how perceptions formed by different beliefs, values, traditions, economy, history, culture, age and gender are reflected in the PNE as a specific literary genre, and how and why this genre re-emerges as a social factor today. Thus, not only the representation of beliefs and traditions in the PNE will be analysed, but also the role of the PNE itself in shaping and changing perspectives on the individual, the state, the economy, and especially on Europe\u2019s historical and cultural past.

These children can experience difficulties with language and speech, motor skills, behaviour, memory, learning, or other neurological functions and benefit from education tailored to their needs. EMPOWER creates a novel platform based on new paradigms from psychology that suggest that Executive Function (EF) and Emotional Self Regulation are two key sets of skills to target in the educational intervention for these students. The core output of EMPOWER is thus an educational platform, co-created by all involved stakeholders, that facilitates the improvement of these key skills in children with NDDs. The platform will be tested and evaluated in school settings with all stakeholders involved according to the strict standards of a randomized clinical trial.
