The analysis of the design exercises will permit quantifying the gains achieved in terms of design cycle time, prediction accuracy, optimization robustness, the efficiency of the noise-mitigation technologies, and eventually the acceleration of the certification process.", "rcn": 259062, "startDate": "2024-01-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01", "title": "EVTOL MULTI-FIDELITY HYBRID DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION FOR LOW NOISE AND HIGH AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE", "topics": "HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-09", "totalCost": 3520000.0, "topic": 8, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/", "x": 6.958286762237549, "y": 2.51169490814209, "count": 24, "representation": "hydrogen | fuel | engine | emissions | ammonia | aircraft | combustion | h2 | aviation | propulsion", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on the optimization and development of propulsion systems utilizing hydrogen technology in aviation for clean and sustainable energy solutions.

This will be achieved due to the following innovations: 1) Holistic optimisation of solvent composition, process design, emission monitoring and control, and solvent management, 2) Validated models for use in commercial process simulators 3) enhanced waste heat integration with carbon capture for reduced external heat demand and operational costs 4) Improved and integrated advanced control system for reduced OPEX and optimised performances. These innovations will be integrated in four optimised capture processes and various aspects will be demonstrated in pilots of various size and complexity. The partners will ensure transferability of results to other CO2 intensive industries thanks to the large variations in CO2 source and developed clusters addressed in the project and  a strong stakeholder participation.

To accelerate the transition, next-generation electric motors need to push the existing boundaries in terms of efficiency, power density, manufacturability, cost, and environmental sustainability. A reduced and more circular use of rare earth resources is critical to reinforce Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy and establish a more economically sustainable value chain. Recently developed axial flux motor technology based on a yokeless and segmented armature topology yields promising prospects in all these areas, significantly reducing the required amount of rare earth magnet material by design, and combining this with unmatched power density compared to state-of-the-art radial flux machines.\nCliMAFlux will develop novel concepts (e.g., in terms of excitation and cooling) for more performant (e.g., >35% energy loss decrease in driving cycles) axial flux motors, thus reducing the need for rare earth materials by 60%, leveraging high-fidelity multiphysics models (e.g., electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, and at the system level) and digital twins. Innovative designs and manufacturing processes will be proposed to: (i) increase the power density to >23 kW/l, through novel materials and improved thermal behaviour; (ii) enhance circularity over the lifetime (including >70% recyclability at the end of life); and (iii) ensure cost competitiveness (50% cost reduction) at mass production level (reaching ~\u20ac5/kW). The CliMAFlux on-board motors are integrated with the power electronics and mechanical transmission systems. The resulting electric drives will be managed by robust predictive controllers based on the CliMAFlux digital twins, including artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models, which will also facilitate novel functionalities in vehicle (sub)systems, hereby exploiting the full capability of the complete electrified drivetrain.

The higher the automation level is, the higher the expectations for the system to cope with these situations are.\nIn the context of this project, these unexpected situations where the normal operation of the CAV is close to be disrupted (e.g. ODD limit is reached due to traffic changes, harsh weather/light conditions, imperfect data, sensor/communication failures, etc.), are called \u201cevents\u201d. EVENTS is also the acronym of this project.\nToday, CAVs are facing several challenges (e.g. perception in complex urban environments, \tVulnerable Road Users (VRUs) detection, perception in adverse weather and low visibility conditions) that should be overcome in order to be able to drive through these events in a safe and reliable way.\nWithin our scope, and in order to cover a wide area of scenarios, these kinds of events are clustered under three main use cases: a) Interaction with VRUs, b) Non-Standard and Unstructured Road Conditions and c) Low Visibility and Adverse Weather Conditions.\nOur vision in EVENTS is to create a robust and self-resilient perception and decision-making system for AVs to manage different kind of \u201cevents\u201d on the horizon. These events result in reaching the AV ODD limitations due to the dynamic changing road environment (VRUs, obstacles) and/or due to imperfect data (e.g. sensor and communication failures). The AV should continue and operate safely no matter what. When the system cannot handle the situation, an improved minimum risk manoeuvre should be put in place.", "rcn": 240458, "startDate": "2022-09-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01", "title": "ReliablE in-Vehicle pErception and decisioN-making in complex environmenTal conditionS", "topics": "HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-01", "totalCost": 6808764.66, "topic": 0, "socsci_project": true, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": true, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101069614", "x": 8.426973342895508, "y": 7.112295627593994, "count": 42, "representation": "ccam | transport | safety | road | ai | traffic | urban | logistics | data | freight", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on urban mobility solutions research including topics such as cooperative mobility systems, safety solutions for urban environments, integrated transport operations, autonomous vehicles, and sustainable and resilient transport.

Although there are energy saving strategies, most innovations cannot simply be merged in conventional ship design. As the solution for making ships carbon neutral will likely come from the use of several energy sources, a clever energy management becomes a key element in a unified ship system. De-rating of engines combined with sailing at slower speed seems to be a relatively easy way to reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions and will most likely be used in the industry. However, this does come with reduced transport work per ship and reduced earnings. In our view, most other savings methods can deliver savings up to about 15%, not the substantial savings that are required. OPTIWISE aims at two solutions that when combined go well beyond 30% when the innovations are delivered as proposed in this project: Wind propulsion with a rigorous, holistic optimised ship design, control and operation, including a change in conventional propeller propulsion. Wind propulsion is showing its potential in research and market introductions. The holistic ship design and operation pair well with that. For common ships there is much to be gained, especially with the increased freedom in the aft ship geometry with a shift to electric propulsion. Making best use of wind propulsion also requires a rethink of designs, control and operations.

The TANDEM project aims to design a methodology allowing policy makers to create and implement inclusive and just transition pathways by involving potentially affected citizens, public authorities, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders. It relies on combination of accessible and complementary methods: deliberative visioning build on art-based approaches, system mapping, assessment and appraisal methods. These methods constitute the backbone of a series of three deliberation panels with citizens. In these panels TANDEM invites participants to create their visions, perspectives and narratives on just transition policies and to define their own criteria and interventions.

This is achieved by demonstrating \u201csmart\u201d aspects in the battery which analyze indicators of its own degradation and independently respond with external stimuli to trigger on-demand self-healing. To achieve this goal, the project proposes 3 types of sensors with 2 types of self-healing mechanisms to counteract the most threatening and damaging reactions that occur in a typical LIB. On the anode, a resistance sensor array will be printed onto its surface to sense the degree of electrode fracture in the silicon/carbon composite anode. The anode will be embedded with a self-healing polymer network which upon thermal activation helps re-bind the silicon nanoparticles. For the cathode, an electrochemical sensor array is printed onto the separator to sense the dissolution of Mn from the LiNiMnCoO2 (NMC) cathode. To prevent Mn ions from critically degrading the cell, the cathode will be embedded with heat-activated scavenging species which remove these ions. Lastly, an internal temperature sensor helps control the degree of thermal activation. In each degradation scenario, the sensors communicate with the battery management system (BMS), which uses a physics-based model to trigger controlled heating to activate self-healing. Additionally, a life cycle assessment will be conducted to validate the recyclability of the SALAMANDER battery and quantify how the environmental impact of manufacturing is offset by longer-lasting batteries. Thus, although the project\u2019s technology is anticipated to be disruptive at the cell and BMS levels, its design would remain compatible with existing manufacturing and recycling processes.

The technology will operate at room temperature and neutral pH using aqueous solutions. In contrast to state-of-the-art photoelectrochemical (PEC) technologies, SUNGATE will not use toxic or critical raw materials, and will combine efficient water oxidation catalysts, with biological components such as photosystem I and enzymes, novel CO2 reducing catalysts and nanostructured diamond-based cathodes to radically improve the efficiency of conversion. The unique modular and scalable design of SUNGATE technology will allow the decarbonised production of solar fuels by increasing the size of the microfluidic PEC device or by numbering up the PEC modules, thus providing the flexibility for diverse applications ranging from decentralised energy infrastructure to closed carbon cycles for industries that emit large amounts of CO2.

An increasing amount of issues are being experienced by distribution system operators while trying to accommodate new systems like renewable energy sources or electric vehicles charging infrastructure. One of the possible solutions is to develop a DC distribution infrastructure, which is especially interesting as most of the new connections mentioned above are native DC sources and loads, respectively. This requires low cost, very efficient and compact DC/DC converters from LV (<1500V) up to MV (>10kV). However,  currently no commercial solutions exist on the market. The aim of this project is to develop and demonstrate a commercial DC/DC converter prototype which can be introduced to the market within short timescale (<3 years) after completion of the project. To achieve such an ambitious target, the project team has decided to focus on the development of ultra- high voltage (UHV) SiC based switching devices which would allow for a remarkable simplification of the converter topology as well as a very compact design when coupled with high frequency operation. For this purpose, the project aims at the design, fabrication and testing of 15 kV SiC IGBTs modules. The choice of the device technology is based on previous studies, which point towards a break-even voltage between SiC MOSFET and SiC IGBT just above 10 kV. Highly relevant, both cost and environmental impact reduction of the fabrication processes will be targeted, using novel approaches for material growth and semiconductor processing.

The difficulties arise when the targets for PV (usually set at national level) needs to be put into practice at regional / local level. Although the PV rooftop potential is extremely large and could potentially contribute to the ambitious targets, the rate of installation of PV rooftop systems will not be fast enough to support a rapid transition. On the other hand, large utility-scale PV installations in open fields are not an option in many regions. It is in this context that the concept of Agrivoltaics is emerging. What several decades of efforts developing Building Integrated PV (BIPV) products and systems for rooftops and facades have taught us is that there are multiple levels of integration and various stakeholders across the value chain which can all generate significant barriers to widespread adoption . Agrivoltaics is in fact in the unique position to learn from the past mistakes made with BIPV which delayed the development of cost-effective BIPV solutions and market acceptance. In SYMBIOSYST we will not develop solutions that are highly customized as this would drive the costs up. We will rather innovate by adapting standardized cost-effective solutions in terms of PV modules, mounting structures and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) practices to the specific needs of various crops in different climates and landscapes.

Current methodologies laid-out by the IPCC for reporting emissions are generally built around the use of statistical data and emission factors. Although they are designed to be transparent, they can have significant uncertainties owing to incomplete or inaccurate information. The 2019 refinement of the IPCC Guidelines highlights the need for independent verification of NGHGIs especially using atmospheric observations. However, the technical complexity and the hitherto limited resolving power of atmospheric constraints makes it challenging for NGHGI compilers to adopt this type of verification. EYE-CLIMA will address this need for independent verification by developing observation-based methods (using both satellite remote sensing and ground-based observations) to a level of readiness where they can be used to determine emissions at national and sub-national scales and for verification of NGHGIs. The methodology involves using process-based and data-driven models to simulate GHG fluxes, first without atmospheric observations, then these fluxes are then combined with models of atmospheric transport and chemistry to assimilate atmospheric observations, which are used to correct the first flux estimates.

Despite decades of research, a persistent fundamental knowledge gap prevents batteries from fulfilling their potential, because the atomistic mechanisms of charge and ion transfer across interfaces in batteries remain largely unexplored by experimental techniques. When charges move, the local arrangement of atoms changes in response to the new electronic configuration. How these changes occur has a significant impact on how efficiently and how far the charges can move, yet the time and length scales are still poorly understood. Conventional experimental probes used in battery research cannot provide the needed ultrafast time and atomic length scale resolution, nor sensitivity to changes in electronic configuration around specific atomic species. Hence, it is currently challenging to unravel the dynamic rearrangement of atoms and ions which accompany electron transfer, and in turn govern the charge transfer processes.\n\nUltraBat will close this knowledge gap by pushing further the latest development of ultra-bright and ultra-fast X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) scattering and spectroscopy techniques together with visible ultrafast spectroscopy to study charge transfer between different redox centres in Li-rich layered intercalation compounds and at the solid/liquid interface.

Transport is a sector where so far it has proved harder to reduce emissions, while being one of the main energy users and source of emissions. Transport sectors such as aviation heavily depend on high energy density fuels, for which sustainable biofuels are the best near term low-carbon renewable alternative. Biofuel production based on algae is being considered as a main clean energy alternative and one of the most promising solutions. However, there are several challenges that hinder development and application of algae-based biofuel, ranging across the entire value chain. SUSTEPS main overall objective is to improve key knowledge, identify systemic constraints and opportunities, and propose solutions for the scaling up of a sustainable algae-based biofuel value chain. It aims to contribute to cost-effective and more sustainable large-scale production of sustainable algae-based biofuels by developing and validating a bio-refinery concept that efficiently produces sustainable biofuel from non-food/feed microalgae via CO2 fixation from high-emission facilities and through feeding on nutrient-rich wastewater, thereby minimising biomass production costs and utilising harmful CO2 emitted from energy-intensive activities. The process will be coupled with green hydrogen to be used in upgrading of microalgae-based fuel, and smart integration of processes that also produce value-added chemicals, valorising all side streams effectively. Based on international collaboration, SUSTEPS will build a more efficient, less costly CO2-to-biofuels process, identifying systemic constraints, opportunities and solutions for scaling up the value chain of algae-based sustainable biofuels which will support the development of best practices and concepts along the entire value chain and accelerate the scale-up of sustainable biofuels worldwide.", "rcn": 256673, "startDate": "2023-09-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL5-2022-D3-03", "title": "SUSTAINABLE, SECURE AND COMPETITIVE ENERGY THROUGH SCALING UP ADVANCED BIOFUEL GENERATION", "topics": "HORIZON-CL5-2022-D3-03-02", "totalCost": 2999536.25, "topic": 2, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/10.3030/101122363", "x": 5.281750679016113, "y": 0.46868500113487244, "count": 35, "representation": "production | process | biomethane | fuel | biomass | renewable | biofuels | co2 | methanol | project", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on advancing sustainable biofuels production and utilization through innovative methods such as thermochemical processes, biomass conversion, and renewable energy integration.

Keeping on working on CSP-sCO2 power cycles and exploiting air as operating fluids also developing novel enabling technologies (receiver, storage etc.), SHARP-sCO2 will attain high working temperatures, guaranteeing reliable and flexible operation, optimal working conditions and high efficiency for the coupling of CSP with sCO2 power cycle thanks to the development of high performant sCO2-air heat exchanger. Leveraging on a smart and integrated hybridization with PV, enabled by the development of an innovative electric heater, SHARP-sCO2 will maximize the production, exploiting PV affordability while counting on the unique energy storage capabilities of CSP plants via thermal media. The latter will be also optimized by developing an innovative high temperature thermal energy storage. SHARP-sCO2, by means of a material selection process driven by environmental and economic criteria and aimed at maximizing the circularity of the solution, will lead also to lower LCOE/CAPEX for future CSP. Developing and validating in EU top level laboratories (IME, KTH, TUD) key cycle components (receiver, storage, HEXs, electric heater) SHARP-sCO2 will prove the effectiveness and techno-economic viability of air-driven/sCO2 CSP cycles. Four prototypes will be investigated in a cross-fertilizing lab campaign (TRL5) also to validate partners\u2019 modeling approach to robustly study cycle integration (via a \u201dcyber-physical approach\u201d). Taking into account EU/extra-EU solar irradiation, electric market perspectives, environmental, safety/regulation aspects too, the project, which involves EU R&D leaders in CSP sector, will be the first keystone towards the promotion of air-driven/sCO2 cycles as key solution for EU CSP plants targeting 2030 EU targets.

The 2DEPLOY methodology will be tested starting with these 5 pilot projects, which will help establish and undergo the project's innovation pipeline. This pipeline consists of several key steps, including: 1) screening H2020 projects through a prequalification matrix and a 1-hour interview with an expert; and 2) an evaluation commission that aims to select only the most mature projects. 3) The chosen projects will then be able to participate in advanced masterclasses that cover six different topics related to the IF's key requirements, such as degree of innovation, scalability, potential for avoided GHG emissions, and technical and financial maturity. 4) Finally, 2DPLOY will offer personalized guidance and feedback to support the preparation of three sound proposals to be submitted to the IF. The 2DPLOY methodology will be constantly improved through a two-way learning strategy that involves collaborations and synergies with key industrial and EU stakeholders, such as the Innovation Fund, the Directorate-General for Climate Action, Processes4Planet, Clean Steel, Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, Batt4EU, and Clean Energy Transition. The activities and achievements developed within the scope of 2DPLOY can then be replicated by relevant HE Partnerships, to accelerate the deployment of mature, promising and high-impact innovations that come out of R&I projects, maybe combined with other de-risk mechanisms that can encourage innovation owners to invest in these technologies and, thus, pave the way for the decarbonisation of EII with European innovative technology.", "rcn": 258518, "startDate": "2024-01-01", "status": "SIGNED", "subCall": "HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-01", "title": "Development of an innovation pipeline to facilitate and promote funding proposals for deployment of low carbon technologies", "topics": "HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-01-07", "totalCost": 0.0, "topic": 3, "socsci_project": false, "hum_project": false, "ssh_project": false, "url": "https://doi.org/", "x": 8.650057792663574, "y": 4.403578758239746, "count": 30, "representation": "plan | innovation | energy | ccus | set | stakeholders | etip | research | eu | support", "summary": "This cluster of projects focuses on supporting stakeholders involved in Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) initiatives in Europe.
